# CNN-Based-Hyperspectral-Image-Classification
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) based hyperspectral image classification is a method of using deep learning techniques to classify hyperspectral data into different categories. This involves using CNN models to learn features from the hyperspectral data, and then using these features to classify the image pixels into different classes.
